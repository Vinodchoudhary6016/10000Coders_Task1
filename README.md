### Completion of 10K Coders Task: Making a Flag, Solar System, and Traffic Lights using CSS Simple Selectors

This repository demonstrates the use of CSS simple selectors by creating three distinct projects: a flag, a solar system, and traffic lights. Each project showcases the power of CSS in creating visually appealing designs with minimal HTML. The projects are designed to highlight the use of element selectors, ID selectors, and class selectors, along with fundamental CSS properties like margin, padding, and border.

### Projects Included:
1. **Flag**: A simple representation of a flag using CSS.
2. **Solar System**: A basic model of the solar system with planets orbiting the sun.
3. **Traffic Lights**: A functional traffic light system with red, yellow, and green lights.

### CSS Concepts Demonstrated:
- **Element Selectors**
- **ID Selectors**
- **Class Selectors**
- **Margin, Padding, and Border Properties**

## CSS Selectors and Properties Explanation

### CSS Element Selector
The element selector targets all elements of a given type.

### CSS ID Selector
The ID selector targets a single element with a specific ID, denoted by a `#`.

### CSS Class Selector
The class selector targets elements with a specific class, denoted by a `.`.

### Margin
The margin property creates space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

### Padding
The padding property creates space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

### Border
The border property specifies the border around an element.

### Border Margin
The border margin is essentially the space outside the border, achieved by setting the margin property.

Feel free to explore the projects to see these CSS properties and selectors in action.
